I originally made this progress to see the temperature in my office. Eventually I added Blynk support to monitor remotely, and separately attached a space heater that I could control remotely.

I had been running the setup for a few years, but I have recently been interested in the Lilygo products, specifically the LCD ESP32s. I wanted a more compact package and updated image.

For this project I added a weather API to get outdoor weather as well.

I'm using an Adafruit DHT 3 pin sensor to keep the package small.

Next steps are to add Blynk support and some nice icons for the weather on the right side of the screen
